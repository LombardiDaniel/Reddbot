## About the Project

Reddbot is a simple discord bot. He will replace pseudo sub-reddit links from your messages (such as `r/some_sub_name`) with the link to the subreddit. He will also remind you that it is Wednesday and the Weeknd. For having such simple functionality, he does not need many permissions, only read and send messages.

### Built With

Build with [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Served to you by [Docker](https://www.docker.com).
